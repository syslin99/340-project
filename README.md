Database and web-based UI for a video game store that tracks its customers, employees, products, and sales and supports CRUD operations for these entities. The database is pre-populated with sample data. The web interface is for the administrator and is not a customer-facing website.

The development of this website utilized many sources. These include but are not limited to the assistance of sites like Youtube, Stack Overflow, W3, and Geeks for Geeks. In addition to these, primary assistance was provided by class explorations, videos and the class repository demonstrating the build of a "nodejs-starter-app" (linked below).
